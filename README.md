# Q-Weather-App
After doing a weather app in my first task at SOC i thought id take another crack at it in Python
-
Deployed with Render

OpenweatherAPI for the data - very user friendly and would highly recommend to use

Back to using traditional CSS for the first time in a while after mainly playing with Tailwind was a nice change also

any feedback appreciated

thank you - and i hope the weather's nice where you are
